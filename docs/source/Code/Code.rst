Here is the code. I'm not a professional programmer. The code is a bit
messy sorry about that. At the begining I tried to use AccelStepper
library for Arduino but couldn't get it work well. (couldn't reach an
appropriate speeed I don't know why) so I remove AccelStepper library
and tried to do something and it worked not badly. Sorry the comments
in the code are in french, I'll translate them soon!

Maybe this video can help to understand the code
