On this page you will find all the information you need to build the
LoveMachine42People. Five parts are dedicated to detail all the
operations of realization. You will find respectively the plans for
the Machine, the Electrical Part, the Fixing Components, the
Accessories and the Wooden Storage Box. 

This page is under construction, so it may not contain all the details
yet. But come back from time to time to see the progress. 

This page takes me a lot of time to write, it would be a great support
if you could make a small donation for its realization by clicking on
the PayPal logo below or by subscribing to my youtube channel.  That
way, I will be all the more motivated to finish it quickly and it will
allow me to know your interest in acquiring the plans of this
machine.
